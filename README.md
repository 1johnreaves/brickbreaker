Brickbreaker clone for GBA (in C)

I made this ROM with the help of TONC, and most of the files needed to run the game are from TONC or were image files turned bitmaps created using Usenti. brickbreaker.c, collision.c, and sprites.h are my own creations; I used TONC help, but the code for the process of running the game itself is all my own. I hope you enjoy!
